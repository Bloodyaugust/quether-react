A react-ified version of [Quether: The Quick Weather App](https://quether.herokuapp.com/).

The original source can be found [here](https://github.com/Bloodyaugust/weather-forecast). This project does not replicate the API behavior.

This project was done in ~4 hours, and has not been optimized for React. Thus, it's a bit ugly in some places...
